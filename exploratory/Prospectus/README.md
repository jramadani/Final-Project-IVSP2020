# Exploratory Visualization Prospectus

The topic that this visualization will center on is the spending habits of the House of Representatives. In building this visualization, I ask, "What do representatives spend the most amount of money on, and who is more likely to spend in what field?" My intended users are people interested in financial transparency in the American legislature--these users are familiar with the topic on a basic level, but likely have only a very loose sense of what the House spends. The data I am using is from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/house-office-expenditures), and I plan to use all of the 2009-2018 detail-level datasets in combination with the summary-level datasets to get a complete picture. If the amount of data becomes too much, I will be reducing the scope to a 5-year period (2013-2018).
