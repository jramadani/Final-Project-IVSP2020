# Abstract

"The 115th Congress & You: Where Did Your Tax Dollars Go?" is a dashboard visualizing the spending habits of the 115th Congress's House of Representatives. In building the dashboard, I asked, "What do representatives spend the most amount of money on, and who is more likely to spend in what field?" The dashboard contains four visualizations: a map of congressional districts, an informational panel with a point of contact for the legislator, a donut chart breaking down that legislator's categorical spending, and a scatterplot showing individual expenditures based on a filtered breakdown of elements selected by the user. Those interested in financial transparency in the American legislature will be served most accurately by this dashboard--these users are familiar with the topic on a basic level, but likely have only a very loose sense of what the House spends. The data used in this dashboard is from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/house-office-expenditures), and consists of 2017 Q1 to 2019 Q1 spending records.
