    <h1>Representation on Wheels (WIP title)</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 36px;">Our representatives are spending a large proportion of their budget on travel.</h2>

      <div><p style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 15px;">
        Of the categories on which representatives spend their budgets, personnel compensation and travel are the top two overall. <br><br>
        When taking into account that each representative has a certain amount of staffers and contractors, each paid a large amount yearly,
        the next most interesting category becomes travel. <br><br>So what are our representatives spending all that travel money on?
      </p></div>

      <div id="treemap"></div>
      <div><p style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 15px;">
        The top 10 travel spenders are largely from red states, but surprisingly, a fair amount of Democrats are also big travel spenders.
        <br> <br> This mostly comes down to location.
      </p></div>

      <div><p style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 15px;">You might be wondering, though: what exactly are these representatives spending all that money on? 
        The top answer is gas mileage reimbursement, which makes sense given that many of the top spenders are from large states like Texas.
      But then there are expenditures like meals and hotels. </div>

      You could make the argument that if being a member of Congress is like being hired at a company, then representatives should have access to funds needed in order to do their jobs, but for the most part, oversight is limited. 
      We the people, as voting HR, don't actually have the ability to fire our representatives.</p></div>
      <div><p style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 15px;">But looking at it further, there's a time for traveling, too: our representatives aren't just traveling to connect with their constituents. 
        </p></div>
      <div id="calendar"></div>
      <div><p style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 15px;">Our representatives are campaigning on tax funds, perpetuating the cycle of incumbency--in other words, it's way more likely they'll get voted into office again.<br>
       <br> While this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective and how much you like your representative, one thing's for sure: it's not really fair.</p></div>
