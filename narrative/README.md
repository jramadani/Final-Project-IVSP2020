# Abstract

"Legislation on the Move" is a narrative breakdown of the travel spending habits of the 115th Congress's House of Representatives. This is an extension of the exploratory dashboard, "The 115th Congress & You: Where Did Your Tax Dollars Go?" and works in tandem with the dashboard. "Legislation on the Move" uses the same data as the exploratory dashboard from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/house-office-expenditures) with a much narrower scope. This project focuses mainly on the top ten travel spenders in the House of Representatives from the 115th Congress: who they pay for travel services, how much they spend on traveling, when they travel the most, and how often they travel in general. As in the exploratory dashboard, this project will appeal most to those with an interest in financial transparency in the U.S. Congress who have only a rudimentary understanding of the House. However, it is highly recommended that users engage with the exploratory dashboard prior to engaging with this project if they are interested in knowing their representative's information and where that information fits into the overall travel spending habits of the 115th Congress's House.
