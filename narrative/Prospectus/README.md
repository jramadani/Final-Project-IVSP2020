# Narrative Project Prospectus

In an extension of the previous project, I will be using the same dataset from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/house-office-expenditures) with a much narrower scope. Where my exploratory project had a broader scope to allow the user to investigate as they wished, this project will focus on the top ten travel spenders in the House of Representatives: who they pay for travel services, how much they spend on traveling, when they travel the most, and how often they travel in general. Not much more analysis will be needed--I expect that only minor aggregation will be necessary. As in the exploratory project, my intended users are people with an interest in financial transparency in the U.S. Congress who have only a rudimentary understanding of the House.
