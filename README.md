# Portfolio Project - A House On A Budget: Spending in the 115th House of Representatives

This repository is an archive of two projects developed for DATA 73200 at the CUNY Graduate Center, in a section taught by Professor Aucher Serr.

## Exploratory - "The 115th Congress & You: Where Did Your Tax Dollars Go?"

The first project, found in its eponymous folder, is an exploratory visualization--a dashboard--that asks the user to delve into the spending habits of the 115th Congress's House of Representatives. [The deployed exploratory visualization can be found here.](https://jramadani.github.io/Final-Project-IVSP2020/exploratory/index.html)

## Narrative - "Legislation on the Move"

The second, also found in its eponymous folder, is a narrative visualization, narrowing the focus of the first, in which we unpack that same dataset's travel subcategory. [The deployed narrative visualization can be found here.](https://jramadani.github.io/Final-Project-IVSP2020/narrative/index.html)

#### Though the semester is over, this project continues to be a work in progress, and I will be iterating on it more in the coming weeks. Thank you for your interest!
